          <h2>Geometric calculations</h2>
          <p>Geometric calculations are an important branch of mathematics used in our daily lives. They focus on studying shapes, areas, volumes, and lengths. These calculations include various geometric shapes such as square, rectangle, circle, triangle, and cube each with its own specific formulas for calculating area, perimeter, or volume.</p>

        <h2>Vision & Mission</h2>
        <p>
          The Geometry Calculator was developed as part of my TMA task at the Arab Open University.
          Faculty of Computer Studies, Department of Computer Science. My mission is to provide students
          and professionals with a simple tool to calculate geometric properties quickly and accurately.
          The project aims to create a platform where shapes like squares, circles, rectangles,
          cubes, and triangles are made easy to understand with a clean and user-friendly interface.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          As a student majoring in Software Engineering, I wanted to build something useful for both
          learning and real-world applications. The goal was to create a tool that simplifies geometric
          calculations, making them more accessible for students, professionals, and anyone who needs
          quick results. This project helps users understand basic geometry concepts in a visual way.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          The Geometry Calculator also helped me improve my coding skills and apply the knowledge
          I’ve learned in my courses. By working on this project, I gained practical experience in
          web development, building a responsive and functional tool that can be accessed from any
          device, anywhere, anytime. This project is a great way to showcase my learning journey.

            <p>
              I have a strong interest in coding and web development, and I created this Geometry Calculator
              as part of my <strong>TMA</strong> task and learning journey. This project reflects my passion for combining
              design and logic to build something practical, useful, and user-friendly.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              As a college student, I'm always eager to apply what I learn by developing real-world tools
              that help others and improve my skills.
